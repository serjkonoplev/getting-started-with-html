<h1> Main concepts</h1>
<b> Part 1</b> <br><br><em><b>World Wide Web (www)</b></em>
  <p>www - is a collection of HTML documents. This documents are made of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</a>.<br>To see this documents i send <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP Request</a> to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">Server</a> via the internet. The main instrument i use to recieve and interpret HTML pages is a browser.</p>
<br><br><em><b>HTML</b></em> "glues" all types of information (videos,music,pictures etc.). 
<br>It contains of : 
<br>-<em>Text content</em> which describes what you see
<br>-<em>Markup</em> which describes what it looks like
<br>-<em>References to other documents</em> such as video, music etc.
<br>-<em>Links to other pages</em>
<br><br><b> Part 2</b>
<br><br><em><b>HTML Markup</b></em> is made up of <em>tags</em>
<!-- i don't understand how to write tags on a web page without making it work, so i use space between less than and greater than symsbols. -->
(<span style="color:#6203AB">< name ></span> <span style="color:#AB0308">content</span> <span style="color:#6203AB">< /name ></span>). If you don't follow the syntax the computer won't show your command in appropriate way. Somethin like this may occure <br> <img src= http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA0LzMwLzVhL2NvZGVob3Jyb3IuNjAzN2QuZ2lmCnAJdGh1bWIJMTIwMHg5NjAwPg/c4112414/f4f/code-horror.gif>
<br><br><em><b>Inline vs Block Element</b></em>
<!-- Actually i didn't clearly understand what it means. -->
<p> HTML elements may be inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p>
